# MyPortfolio
Welcome to my personal portfolio website. A personal summer project I designed. It serves as both a creative outlet and a professional introduction, giving visitors a glimpse into my skills, personality & the work I have completed so far. The structure of the site is simple & easy to navigate, with 3 main sections: Home, Portfolio & Skills.
