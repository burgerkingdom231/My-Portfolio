# Name & Function Portfolio
Bri K’s Website” – This project is a personal portfolio website designed to introduce who I am, highlight my skills and interests and provide a space to share my advocacy efforts around period poverty awareness.

# Why It Was Made
It was a summer project for Girls Who Code (SPP)

# How It Was Made
HTML: Provides the structure of the site (navigation, headings, sections for about me, portfolio and skills).
CSS: Styles the site, ensuring it looks clean, organized and easy to read.
JavaScript: Adds interactivity. Specifically, a script enables smooth scrolling when you click navigation links.

# Struggles 
While creating this portfolio, I faced challenges such as:
- Structuring clean, organized HTML for multiple sections.
- Making the design look cohesive and easy to navigate.
- Learning how to host and update a site using GitHub Pages.
  
# Learnings
- The importance of semantic HTML for readability and accessibility.
- How CSS can transform a plain page into a polished site.
- Basic deployment workflows with GitHub Pages.
