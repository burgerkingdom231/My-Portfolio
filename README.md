# MyPortfolio
Welcome to my personal portfolio website. A personal summer project I designed. It serves as both a creative outlet and a professional introduction, giving visitors a glimpse into my skills, personality &amp; the work I have completed so far. The structure of the site is simple &amp; easy to navigate, with 4 main sections: Home, Portfolio, About &amp; Project.
