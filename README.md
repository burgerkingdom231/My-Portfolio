# Name & Function Portfolio
Bri K’s Website” – This project is a personal portfolio website designed to introduce who I am, highlight my skills and interests and provide a space to share my advocacy efforts around period poverty awareness.

# Why It Was Made
It was a summer project for Girls Who Code (SPP)

# How It Was Made
HTML: Provides the structure of the site, including navigation, sections (About, Portfolio, Skills) and card layouts.
CSS: Styles the site and adds animations for a more dynamic user experience. Key features include:
     - Flip Cards: Used in the skills section. Each card flips on hover to reveal more information.
     - Animations: Heading effects that makes the site more engaging..
JavaScript: Adds interactivity and smooth user navigation. Key features include:
     - Smooth Scrolling: When clicking nav links, the page scrolls naturally instead of jumping.
     - Event Handling: Script listens for clicks and updates how content is displayed dynamically.

# Struggles 
While creating this portfolio, I faced challenges such as:
    - Structuring clean, organized HTML for multiple sections.
    - Making the design look cohesive and easy to navigate.
    - Learning how to host and update a site using GitHub Pages.

   ** This is a school project that is still in its early stage....**

  
# Learnings
   - The importance of semantic HTML for readability and accessibility.
   - How CSS can transform a plain page into a polished site.
   - Basic deployment workflows with GitHub Pages.
